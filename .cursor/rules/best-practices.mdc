# Development Best Practices

## Code Organization
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Follow the established file structure
- Use meaningful component and variable names

## Performance
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper key props for lists
- Optimize images and assets

## Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper ARIA labels

- Avoid prop drilling by using context when needed

## Error Handling
- Implement error boundaries for React components
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately

## Testing
- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Test component behavior, not implementation
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Test accessibility features

## Code Quality
- Follow ESLint rules
- Use Prettier for consistent formatting
- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

## Git Workflow
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Use feature branches for new development
- Review code before merging
- Keep commits atomic and focused

## Security
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before rendering
- Use HTTPS in production
- Follow OWASP guidelines
