# SheBuilds Styling Guidelines

## Design System

- Use the existing color scheme with orange/amber as primary accent colors
- Typography uses:
  - "font-martian" for headings (lighter weight for main headings)
  - "font-inter" for body text

## CSS Patterns

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with consistent class patterns
- Maintain responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Animation classes follow these naming conventions:
  - "animate-float" for floating elements
  - "animate-pulse-orange" for pulsing text effects

## Component Structure

- Section components should include:
  - Intersection Observer for scroll-based animations
  - Consistent padding: "py-16 px-6" or "py-20 px-6"
  - Wrapper with "max-w-6xl mx-auto"

## Animation Effects

- Use smooth transitions with consistent durations:
  - "transition-all duration-300" for hover effects
  - "transition-all duration-1000" for scroll-reveal effects
  
- Components should fade and slide in with staggered delays:
  ```jsx
  <div className={`transition-all duration-1000 delay-${delay} ${
    isVisible ? 'opacity-100 translate-y-0' : 'opacity-0 translate-y-8'
  }`}>
  ```
